# Vacant Classroom Finder - Fix Implementation

## âœ… Completed Tasks

### 1. **Identified the Core Issue**
- **Problem**: The `getRoomStatus` function was using exclusive end time (`<`) which created 1-minute gaps between consecutive classes
- **Impact**: Rooms appeared vacant during transitions between classes, even when they should be occupied
- **Root Cause**: `searchTimeInMinutes < logicalEndTimeInMinutes` logic

### 2. **Implemented the Fix**
- **Solution**: Changed to inclusive end time (`<=`) to prevent gaps
- **New Logic**: `searchTimeInMinutes <= endTimeInMinutes`
- **File Updated**: `index_fixed.html` with corrected implementation

### 3. **Enhanced Conflict Detection**
- **Added**: Comprehensive conflict detection for multiple subjects in same room/time
- **Added**: Priority-based conflict resolution (non-CEC/ELECTIVE subjects prioritized)
- **Added**: Console warnings for debugging conflicts
- **Added**: Visual indicators for conflicted schedules

### 4. **Improved Time Handling**
- **Added**: Better time validation and error handling
- **Added**: Support for classes that span midnight
- **Added**: More robust time conversion functions

## ðŸ”§ Key Changes Made

### Time Comparison Logic Fix
```javascript
// OLD (problematic):
const isTimeMatch = (searchTimeInMinutes >= startTimeInMinutes && searchTimeInMinutes < logicalEndTimeInMinutes);

// NEW (fixed):
const isTimeMatch = (searchTimeInMinutes >= startTimeInMinutes && searchTimeInMinutes <= endTimeInMinutes);
```

### Conflict Resolution
- Detects when multiple classes are scheduled in same room at same time
- Prioritizes regular subjects over special subjects (CEC, ELECTIVE, etc.)
- Shows only one subject per room per time slot
- Logs conflicts to console for debugging

## ðŸ§ª Testing Required

### Critical Path Testing
1. **Test consecutive classes** - Verify no gaps between classes (e.g., 10:10-11:05, 11:05-12:00)
2. **Test room conflicts** - Verify only one subject shows when conflicts exist
3. **Test different time slots** - Check various times throughout the day
4. **Test different days** - Verify Monday through Friday schedules

### Edge Cases to Test
1. **Class transitions** - Test exact start/end times of classes
2. **Special subjects** - Test CEC, ELECTIVE, PROJECTBASEDLEARNING handling
3. **Different room types** - Test CR, LT, LAB, UBUNTU, TCL rooms
4. **Time validation** - Test invalid time formats

## ðŸ“‹ Next Steps

1. **Run the application** using `index_fixed.html`
2. **Test with live data** from `timetable.json`
3. **Verify conflict resolution** works correctly
4. **Check console logs** for any warnings or errors
5. **Test different time periods** to ensure no gaps exist

## ðŸŽ¯ Expected Results

After the fix, the system should:
- âœ… Show rooms as occupied during entire class duration
- âœ… Show only one subject per room per time slot
- âœ… Eliminate gaps between consecutive classes
- âœ… Properly handle scheduling conflicts
- âœ… Display clear status indicators (Occupied/Vacant)

## ðŸš¨ Known Issues in Data

The `timetable.json` contains scheduling conflicts where multiple subjects are assigned to the same room at the same time. The fix handles these by:
- Detecting conflicts
- Prioritizing regular subjects over special ones
- Showing only the highest priority subject
- Logging conflicts for debugging
